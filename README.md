This will be my practice repository to learn to use Copilot and Codex.

## Nail Biting Game
A small in-browser game to help track nail-biting habits. Click **I Resisted!** whenever you fight the urge and **I Succumbed** when you give in. Every ten points levels you up and the on-screen nails now grow upward to show progress; losing a level shortens them. The nail graphics are arranged like a real hand for clarity. Use the **Reset** button to return everything to the starting state.
