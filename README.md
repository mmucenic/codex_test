This will be my practice repository to learn to use Copilot and Codex.

## Nail Biting Game
A small in-browser game to help track nail-biting habits. Click **I Resisted!** whenever you fight the urge and **I Succumbed** when you give in. Every ten points levels you up and the on-screen nails grow; losing a level shortens them. The nail graphics now resemble a hand so you can see your progress more clearly. Use the **Reset** button to start over at any time.
